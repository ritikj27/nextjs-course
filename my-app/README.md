## React server components

-server comp
 && in nextjs all compoents are server compoents by deafult
 && they have the ablity to run tasks like reading files or fetching data from a db.
 && howerver ,they don,t have the ability to use hooks or handle user interaction .
&& client comp
 - to create client comp,its necessary to add "use client" at the top of component file


# routing
    &&** nextjs has a file system based routing mechanism
    &&** url paths that users can access in the brower are defined by files and folder in ur codebase .


# Routing Conventions
    ** All routes must be placed inside the app folder
    ** Every file that corresponds to a route must be named page.js or page.tsx
    ** Every folder corresponds to a path segment in the browser URL


# app folder
 #page.tsx -> home page
 #folfer -> page.tsx repsent new route


# nested routes
 /blogs
 /blogs/first
 /blogs/second

# dyncamic routes
/products
/products/id
    #app folder
    #page.tsx -> home page
    #products -> page.tsx,#[id] folder ->page.tsx

    import React from 'react'

    export default function ProductDetails({params}:any) {
    return (
        <div>ProductDetails {params.productid}</div>
    )
    }


# nested dynamic routes
/product/id
/product/1/review/1


# catch-all segment
/docs/feature1/concept1
/docs/feature2/concept2
/docs/feature2/concept1
/docs/feature1/concept2

 - we can use
    #folderDocs
        #[...slug]
            -page.tsx

    ** to view without any slug (/docs) ([[...slug]])


# not found page
    ** use app>not-found.tsx file

    ** there a one notFound() are aslo there


# Private Folders
    ** A private folder indicates that it is a private implementation detail and should not be considered by the routing system
    T** he folder and all its subfolders are excluded from routing
    ** prefix the name with underscore


## Private Folders contd.
 ** For separating Ul logic from routing logic
 ** For consistently organizing internal files across a project
 ** For sorting and grouping files in code editors
 ** And finally, for avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file conventions


## Route Groups
 ** Allows us to logically group our routes and project files without affecting the URL path structure
** Let's implement authentication routes
    Register
    Login
    Forgot password
 ## one options we make auth folder

    #auth
        #login
        #register
        #forgetPwd

## second options we make (auth) folder

    #(auth) using parenthis
        #login
        #register
        #forgetPwd


## Layouts
   **  A page is UI that is unique to a route
   **  A layout is Ul that is shared between multiple pages in the app


## How to Create Layouts
    You can define a layout by default exporting a React component from a layout.js or layout.tsx file

    That component should accept a children prop that will be populated with a child page during rendering

## Routing Metadata
    Ensuring proper search engine optimization (SEO) is crucial for increasing visibility and attracting users

    Next.js introduced the Metadata API which allows you to define metadata for each page

    Metadata ensures accurate and relevant information is displayed when your pages are shared or indexed


## Configuring Metadata
    Export a static metadata object
    Export a dynamic generate Metadata function
 ## Metadata rules
    Both layout.tsx and page.tsx files can export metadata. If defined in a layout, it applies to all pages in that layout, but if defined in a page, it applies only to that page

    Metadata is read in order, from the root level down to the final page level
    When there's metadata in multiple places for the same route, they get combined, but page metadata will replace layout metadata if they have the same properties

# title metadata
    root layout
    export const metadata:Metadata = {
        title:{
            default:"Nextjs",
            template:"%s | Coder"
        },
        description: 'Generated by Next.js',
    }
    child layout

    export const metadata:Metadata ={
        title:"Blog apge"
    }

    output title of blog page will be blog page | coder

## using absoulte properties
    export const metadata:Metadata ={
        title:{
            absolute:"Blog !!!"
        }
    }
    output will be Blog !!! (it will overwrite root title in blog page)
